                On December 18, 1856 a genius was born that would raise a son that would mirror his father. Joseph
                John
                Thomson was that father. Through the help of his experiments the verification of electrons was made
                and
                atomic models followed. His son, George Paget Thomson would later contribute greatly to his father’s
                works showing that the particle that his father had discovered also had properties that mimic waves.
                Although not Chemist themselves, their contributions led to both of them receiving Nobel Prizes in
                their
                pioneering research in helping to describe an electron that is very useful in the field of Chemistry
                (NobelPrize).
            </p>

            <p>
                Joseph John Thomson’s experiment which led to some conclusions that his son would later perfect
                involved
                cathode ray tubes. This experiment would show that all atoms have a very tiny negatively charged
                subatomic particles that are called elections (KHAN).
            </p>

            <p>
                The experiment worked by sealing glass tubes and having all the air vacuumed out. At either end of
                the
                tubes are electrodes. When a high voltage is applied to these electrodes a beam of particles flow
                from
                the cathode to the anode. The cathode is negatively charged electrode and the anode is positively
                charged anode. This device is called a Cathode Ray for the simple fact that the particle beam starts
                at
                the cathode. A material known as phosphors will emit a light, spark, as it detects a ray that has
                “paint[ed]” it (KAHN).
            </p>

            <p>
                Thomson being the genius he was placed two oppositely charged electric plates on opposite sides of
                the
                cathode. The ray that was emitted by the cathode ray pushed away from the negatively charged
                electric
                plate, and pulled towards the positively charged plate. Thomson concluded that the cathode ray
                itself
                must be electrically charged (KAHN).
            </p>

            <p>
                The experiments would lead to major discoveries that helped to describe characteristics of the
                particle.
                Thomson discovered the mass to charge ratio of the particles emitted by the cathode ray. This meant
                that
                this particle was really really small. So small, it was smaller than any atom that was known at the
                time
                (KAHN).
            </p>

            <p>
                Thomson was thorough, he did the experiment over and over with different electrode materials, but
                the
                same results persisted (KAHN). He concluded that these particles were negatively charged, that they
                existed as part of an atom, and that they could be found in all elements (KAHN).
            </p>

            <p>
                Sir Joseph J Thomson, Mathematical Physicist, President of the Royal Society 1916-1920, commenting
                on
                Electrical Engineering in his own words on film, October 18th 1934, he was 78 at the time. He
                emphasized, “that all major discovers were made without any practical thought of application”. And,
                that
                some discovers “seemed quite unfitting for such a purpose… Consider the discovery of the electron.
                Could
                anything at first sight seem so impractical”. He then quotes Shakespeare in the most amazing way,
                “My
                use is great, because I am so small”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Joseph John Thomson spent years lecturing on physics, and electrical engineering. In his book
                Recollections and Reflections on page 82, he writes:

                “Though eighteen hours a week spent in teaching may be thought to leave little time for research, …
                There is no better way of getting a good grasp of your subject, or one more likely to start more
                ideas
                for research, than teaching it or lecturing about it, especially if you hearers know very little
                about
                it, and it is all to the good if they are rather stupid” (Institute of Electrical Engineering).
            </p>

            <p>
                Teaching was his passion, a rhythmic experience to get closer to a subatomic truth. It was this
                passion
                that must had led him to be such a great role model of a father to raise such an excellent son.
            </p>

            <p>
                His son is George Paget Thomson, born 1892 at Cambridge. In a testimony to the father’s teachings,
                he
                grew up to attend Cambridge, followed his father’s footsteps in physics, and even conducted research
                with his father when in 1914, war began. George doing what was right, joined the Queen’s Regiment of
                Infantry. Later he would help the war effort in other ways, including “aerodynamical problems”
                (NobelPrize).
            </p>

            <p>
                When the war ended he became a lecturer and conducted research in the field of physics at Corpus
                Christi
                College, Cambridge. It was later when teaching as a Professor at University of Aberdeen that he
                would
                conduct experiments that would forever change the way scholars would look upon the electron that his
                father had help to discover (NobelPrize).
            </p>

            <p>
                The experiment involved the very same electrons that his father once described, and having them go
                through a very thin piece of metal. There was an understanding that an electron was a particle and
                if it
                is such a thing, it must behave as such. This is not what George uncovered. His experiments showed
                that
                the electron was not displaying the characteristics of a particle, but instead that of waves. Unlike
                particles which are packaged and quantized, while waves show patterns of diffraction. This opened
                the
                door for from Classical Mechanics to Quantum Mechanics (NoblePrize).
            </p>

            <p>
                Like father, like son. Like particle, like wave, the duality of it all. George never stopped
                teaching.
                He would go to work at Imperial College, where his passion led him to nuclear physics. There he
                contributed by experimenting on fission of uranium by neutron. Fission was discovered in 1939.
                George
                being the veteran that he was, thought it could be used for military purposes to help end wars. For
                the
                nature of an infantryman is to kill the enemy to ensure his brother in arms come home to their love
                ones. He convinced British Air Ministry to acquire a ton of uranium oxide. Although his experiments
                did
                not yield the results that he wanted, the knowledge that he gained helped later when the British
                Government needed his expertise to acknowledge that a bomb could be made with such material. This
                information was passed to their American counterparts (NobelPrize).

                George Paget Thomson, Physics: Year of Award 1937, Lecture: Discovery of the Electron at the 15th
                Lindau
                meeting, 1965, in his own recorded words stated that “the electron was named before it was
                discovered.
                Johnstone Stoney, an Irish Physicist, perhaps it is difficult for his country to accept a word that
                did
                not exist” coined the word. George went on the say that “The electron now for nearly 70 years has
                stood
                for the fusion of two quite distinct ideas, and a failure to realize this has led to some
                unnecessary
                controversy that had better have been avoided”.
            </p>

            <p>
                These two men, Giants in the field of physics have helped to shape the world that we find ourselves
                living in. Sir Joseph Thomson said it best, “That any new discover contains the germs of a new
                industry.
                It is said that great electrical firm in America instruct the members of their research department
                to
                discover something. No matter what. And, then to lead to another department, the business of making
                money out of it. And, I think experience has shown that that department generally does…. Scientific
                discovers are very efficient means of creating employment” (Institute of Electrical Engineers).
            </p>

            <p>
                The people that live today live on the shoulder of Giants. Giants that have paved the way for others
                to
                live a life in comfort, to have jobs in ever advancing fields, and most of all, to already studied,
                researched, and made advancements in a field so that others can push science further than ever
                before.
                These advancements can only take place when individuals work together. As perfectly illustrated when
                George Thomson helped his father with research before the war. It is also perfectly illustrated by
                our
                advanced technological environment and how far we came. There is an old saying, “If I want what you
                have, I must do the things you have done”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both Joseph and George never stopped teaching, lecturing, speaking on the subject. Engulfed by these
                ideas on a daily basis, they were able to interrupt what needed to be done to advance the field of
                physics in Electrical Engineering. And, for George in Nuclear Engineering. In this, they helped
                changed
                the world, and maybe, just maybe, many individuals can be inspired to do what they have done. To
                become
                a Giant in the field of science.
